# YP-Scraper
Scrapes the Yellow Pages increadibly fast. If you are having trouble running 800-900 concurrent connections /threads get a new router or drop the number. Writing to the SQLite3 DB is not as fast as scraping CTRL+C once! will stop the scraping and allow the DB to continue writing. Pressing the Key Combination again will stop the DB writing as well
